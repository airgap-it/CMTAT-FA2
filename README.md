# CMTA FA2 Blueprint Implementation

The [Capital Markets and Technology Association](https://www.cmta.ch/)
(CMTA) has published [a
guide](https://cmta.ch/standards/standard-for-the-tokenization-of-shares-of-swiss-corporations-using-the-distributed-ledger-technology)
regarding the tokenization a Swiss corporation's shares, as well as a
[token framework](https://cmta.ch/standards/cmta-token-cmtat) (the CMTA
Token, CMTAT), for which a reference implementation in Solidity [is
available](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT). 

The present repository provides an implementation of the CMTAT standard
for the Tezos ecosystem, based on the [FA2 token
standard](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-12/).
There are two main differences compared to the Solidity reference
contract:

- FA2 allows for multiple tokens on the same contract. This of course means that we can have per token
an admin who gets the token 'owner' status as per CMTAT. Since 'owner' in FA2 receives another semantic
 we a use the expression 'token admin' to relate to the 'CMTAT token owner' and 'token owners' for us
 are what CMTAT calls 'holders'.
- For gas optimization purposes where it makes sense the entry points have been extended to accept lists. 
This allows for batched operations. 

*Warning:* Unless you know for certain that all tokens handled by the contract have to be destroyed in case of a “kill”, we recommend deploying/originating one contract per token.

## Glossary
 - Owner (CMTAT):        the administrator of a specific token_id (one per token_id).
 - Holder (CMTAT):       the token holder (n per token_id). In our context the actual shareholder.
 - Super Administrator:   the administrator that can create new assets and/or kill the entire contract.
 - Administrator:         the administrator of a specific token_id (one per token_id).
 - Owner:                 the token holder (n per token_id). In our context the actual shareholder.
 - Batch:                 allow for multiple changes/executions in one method call. Will always fail for all requests (and revert) in case a single one fails.
 - Plurals:               plurals are used in the variable name to signal a list. If the plural does not make sense, we choose the _list postfix. 

## Functionality

### Token Metadata

We follow the FA2 standard for the metadata specification. The TZIP-16
standard allows to extend the metadata with arbitrary fields. As per
CMTAT we are using the following mapping.

Mandatory attributes, applicable to all CMTAT tokens:

| Specification | Metadata Key |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Name |  name |
| Ticker symbol (optional) |  symbol |
| Token ID (ISIN or other identifier) (optional) |  fa2 has by default a token ID |
| Reference to the terms of tokenization, the terms of the instrument, and other relevant documents (e.g. prospectus or key information document). The reference can take the form of an URL, a combination of an URL and of specific directions allowing the user to retrieve the relevant documents (e.g. "[domain].com/shares > Tokens") or a fingerprint.  |  terms |
| Note that decimals number must be set to zero (which means that the tokens admit no fractional parts). |  decimals always set to 0 |

Optional attributes, applicable to tokens used for debt securities:

| Specification | Metadata Key |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Guarantor identifier (if any) |  guarantor |
| Bondholder representative identifier (if any) | bondholder |
| Maturity date | maturityDate |
| Interest rate | interestRate |
| Par value (principal amount) | parValue |
| Interest schedule format (if any). The purpose of the interest schedule is to set, in the parameters of the smart contract, the dates on which the interest payments accrue.<br>Format A: start date/end date/period<br>Format B: start date/end date/day of period (e.g. quarter or year)<br>Format C: date 1/date 2/date 3/…. | interestSchedule |
| Interest payment date (if different from the date on which the interest payment accrues:<br>Format A: period (indicating the period between the accrual date for the interest payment and the date on which the payment is scheduled to be made)<br>Format B: specific date | interestPaymentDate |
| Day count convention | dayCountConvention |
| Business day convention | businessDayConvention |
| Public holidays calendar | publicHolidaysCalendar | 

You can find a sample token metadata in the metadata folder. Once uploaded to either a static URL or IPFS you can simply convert the UTF8 string of the URI to bytes and set said bytes in the `set_token_metadata` entry point. 

### Rule Engine

The CMTAT-FA2 reference implementation allows customizations around the transferrability to be implemented using the rule engine. This has the advantage that upgrades to the logic can be applied by the token admin by calling the `set_rule_engines` entrypoint. The only interface a rule engines is required to implement to be valid is the on-chain view `view_is_transfer_valid(transfer: ValidationTransfer)` which returns a bool. 
 
If a rule contract is set, it needs to provide a `view_is_transfer_valid(transfer: ValidationTransfer)` on-chain view which returns a bool, this view will be invoked on transfer, if it passes (returns true) the transfer will go through, if it fails (returns false) the transfer is rolled back.

The rule engine can be used for use cases like freezing or KYC/DID checks. A reference implementation of such a rule engine is provided for the Freezing/Unfreezing of accounts.

#### Freezing/Unfreezing of accounts

CMTA has in the specifications the ability to freeze/unfreeze accounts. Frozen accounts won't be allowed to send or receive tokens. Because the rule engine is the perfect candidate to handle this, instead of creating the reference implementation inside the `CMTAFA2` contract we provide a reference implementation of a freeze rule engine called `FreezeRuleEngine` (`contracts/freeze_rule_engine.py`). The tests show how this can be used.

### Snapshots

The contract allows creating on-chain snapshots which are implemented in a computationally efficient way for entry points with state changes (no loops). Only viewing the snapshot has a loop which scales linearly with the number of snapshots (per token).

The admin of a specific token can schedule 1 snapshot for the future (for that token) using the `schedule_snapshot` entry point. To reschedule a future snapshot you Schedules a snapshot for the future for a specific token. Only one snapshot can be scheduled, repeated call will fail, to re-schedule you need to unschedule using the `unschedule_snapshot` entry point first.

On chain, you can check the snapshot values by consuming the views `view_snapshot_total_supply` and `view_snapshot_balance_of`.

## entry points
### `transfer(self, transfers)`

Slightly adapted FA2 transfer method which includes pause, rule engine and snapshot functionality.

### `set_identity(self, identity)`

Allows a user to set the own identity.

### `kill(self)`

Wipes irreversibly the storage and ultimately kills the contract such that it can no longer be used. All tokens on it will be affected. Only special admin of token id 0 can do this.

### `unschedule_snapshot(self, token_id)`

Unschedules the scheduled snapshot for the given token_id. Only token administrator can do this. 

### `schedule_snapshot(self, token_id, snapshot_timestamp)`

Schedules a snapshot for the future for a specific token. Only one snapshot can be scheduled, repeated call will fail, to re-schedule you need to unschedule using the `unschedule_snapshot` entry point first. Only token administrator can do this.


### `delete_snapshot(self, snapshot_lookup_key)`
Deletes a snapshot for the given snapshot lookup key (consisting of token_id = sp.TNat, snapshot_timestamp = sp.TTimestamp). Only token administrator can do this.

### `set_rule_engines(self, rules)`

Allows specifying the rules contract for a specific token, only a token administrator can do this.

### `unpause(self, token_ids)`

Allows unpausing tokens, only a token administrator can do this.

### `pause(self, token_ids)`

Allows pausing tokens, only a token administrator can do this.

### `burn(self, token_amounts)`

Allows burning tokens on the defined recipient address, only a token administrator can do this.

### `mint(self, token_amounts)`

Allows minting new tokens to the defined recipient address, only a token administrator can do this.

### `initialise_token(self, token_ids)`

Initialise the token with the required additional token context, can only be called once per token and only one of its admin can call this.

### `remove_administrator(self, token_id, administrator_to_remove)`

This removes a administrator entry entirely from the map. 

*Warning*: Administrators can remove themselves. Even the super-administrator.

### `set_administrator(self, token_id)`

Only a proposed admin can call this entry point. If the sender is correct the new admin is set.
    
### `propose_administrator(self, token_id, proposed_administrator)`

This kicks off the process of adding a new administrator for a specific token. First you propose and then the proposed admin can set him/herself with the set_administrator entry point.

### `set_token_metadata(self, token_metadata_list)`

The definition of a new token requires its metadata to be set. Only the administrators of a certain token can edit existing. If no token metadata is set for a given ID the sender will become admin of that token automatically.

### `balance_of(self, balance_of_request)`

As per FA2 standard, takes balance_of requests and responds on the provided callback contract.
    
### `update_operators(self, update_operators)`

As per FA2 standard, allows a token owner to set an operator who will be
allowed to perform transfers on their behalf.

## Views

### `view_total_supply(self, token_id)`

Given a token id allows the consumer to view the current total supply.
    
### `view_balance_of(self, ledger_key)`

Given a ledger key (consisting of token_id = sp.TNat, owner = sp.TAddress) allows the consumer to view the current balance.
    
### `view_current_snapshot(self, token_id)`

Given a token id allows the consumer to view the current snapshot timestamp. Can be null. 
    
### `view_next_snapshot(self, token_id)`

Given a token id allows the consumer to view the next snapshot timestamp. Can be null.

### `view_snapshot_balance_of(snapshot_ledger_key)`

Given the snapshot ledger key (consisting of token_id = sp.TNat, owner = sp.TAddress, snapshot_timestamp = sp.TTimestamp) allows the consumer to retrieve the balance in nat of a given snapshot.

### `view_snapshot_total_supply(self, snapshot_lookup_key)`

Given the snapshot lookup key (consisting of token_id = sp.TNat, snapshot_timestamp = sp.TTimestamp) allows the consumer to retrieve the total supply in nat of a given snapshot.
